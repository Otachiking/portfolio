      This project was developed for **InSight**, a prestigious data analytics competition that challenges participants to extract meaningful insights from real-world digital marketing data across multiple industries.

      Our team analyzed performance data spanning FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods), Beauty, and Fashion industries to uncover critical business patterns, identify optimization opportunities, and deliver actionable strategic recommendations that drive measurable impact.

      Beyond just data analysis, we built an interactive analytics platform that transforms complex datasets into clear, compelling visual narratives— empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions with confidence.

      **Competition Context: InSight**

      InSight is a data analytics competition focused on transforming raw marketing data into strategic business recommendations. Participants are challenged to demonstrate not just technical analysis skills, but also business acumen and storytelling ability.

      **Problem Statement**

      Given 12 months of digital marketing performance data across multiple clients and industries, our objectives were to:
      - Identify key performance trends and anomalies
      - Uncover cross-industry patterns and differences
      - Develop actionable recommendations for budget optimization
      - Present findings in an engaging, accessible format

      **Analytical Approach**

      Our methodology followed a structured framework:

      - **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Handled missing values, standardized formats, and reconciled currency differences using Python (Pandas)
      - **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identified seasonality patterns, channel effectiveness, and conversion funnel bottlenecks
      - **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted correlation studies between traffic sources and conversion rates
      - **Visualization Development**: Built interactive charts using Plotly.js for dynamic data exploration

      **Key Insights Discovered**

      - **Seasonal Sensitivity**: Fashion shows 3x higher seasonal variance than FMCG, requiring more agile budget allocation strategies
      - **Channel Efficiency**: TikTok emerges as top ROAS channel for Beauty industry with average 4.2x return
      - **Traffic Quality**: Organic traffic converts 2.8x better than paid across all industries
      - **Mobile Dominance**: 78% of Beauty industry traffic is mobile, demanding mobile-first optimization

      **Strategic Recommendations**

      Based on our analysis, we proposed industry-specific strategies:
      - **FMCG**: Focus on discount-driven campaigns during low seasons
      - **Beauty**: Shift budget toward TikTok and prioritize mobile UX optimization  
      - **Fashion**: Implement dynamic budget reallocation based on seasonal forecasting

      **Platform Development**

      Built an interactive web platform using:
      - **Backend**: Python with Streamlit for rapid prototyping
      - **Visualization**: Plotly.js for interactive, drill-down capable charts
      - **Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel for seamless presentation access

      **Competition Outcome**

      Our solution was recognized for its comprehensive analytical approach and clear strategic recommendations, demonstrating the power of data-driven decision making in digital marketing optimization.
