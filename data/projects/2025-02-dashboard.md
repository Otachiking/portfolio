      A comprehensive redesign of an enterprise analytics dashboard serving over 5,000 daily active users. The existing interface suffered from information overload, inconsistent visual hierarchy, and poor mobile responsiveness. Our goal was to create a cleaner, more intuitive experience that reduces cognitive load while improving data discoverability.

      **Discovery Phase**
      We began with extensive user research including 24 user interviews, session recordings analysis, and heuristic evaluation of the existing interface. Key pain points identified:
      - Users spent average 4.2 clicks to reach commonly needed reports
      - 67% of users never discovered advanced filtering options
      - Mobile usage was abandoned due to unusable table layouts

      **Design Strategy**
      Our approach centered on progressive disclosure—showing essential information upfront while making detailed data easily accessible. We established a clear visual hierarchy using typography scale and strategic use of color for data states.

      **Iteration Cycles**
      Conducted 5 rounds of usability testing with high-fidelity prototypes, iterating on navigation patterns, chart types, and information density. Each round included participants from different user segments (executives, analysts, operators).

      The redesigned dashboard launched to positive reception, with measurable improvements across all key metrics. User satisfaction scores increased from 3.1 to 4.6 out of 5, and support tickets related to "finding reports" decreased by 78%.

      The new design system we created was adopted across three other products in the client's portfolio, establishing a consistent user experience and reducing future design and development time.

      **Design Decisions:**
      - Chose card-based layout for scannability and responsive flexibility
      - Implemented contextual actions to reduce menu hunting
      - Created a custom chart component library for consistent data visualization

      **Accessibility Focus:**
      - All charts include data tables for screen reader users
      - Color palette tested for deuteranopia and protanopia
      - Keyboard navigation implemented for all interactive elements
      - Focus indicators visible and consistent throughout

      **Lessons Learned:**
      - Early stakeholder alignment on metrics prevented scope creep
      - Real user data often contradicts stated preferences—observe, don't just ask
      - Design system investment pays dividends in long-term maintenance
