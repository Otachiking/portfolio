      A comprehensive redesign of an enterprise analytics dashboard serving over 5,000 daily active users. The existing interface suffered from information overload, inconsistent visual hierarchy, and poor mobile responsiveness. Our goal was to create a cleaner, more intuitive experience that reduces cognitive load while improving data discoverability.

      **Discovery Phase**
      We began with extensive user research including 24 user interviews, session recordings analysis, and heuristic evaluation of the existing interface. Key pain points identified:
      - Users spent average 4.2 clicks to reach commonly needed reports
      - 67% of users never discovered advanced filtering options
      - Mobile usage was abandoned due to unusable table layouts

      **Design Strategy**
      Our approach centered on progressive disclosure—showing essential information upfront while making detailed data easily accessible. We established a clear visual hierarchy using typography scale and strategic use of color for data states.

      **Iteration Cycles**
      Conducted 5 rounds of usability testing with high-fidelity prototypes, iterating on navigation patterns, chart types, and information density. Each round included participants from different user segments (executives, analysts, operators).
