      **AI Integration Architecture**

      FiFuFa is powered by IBM Granite 3.3-8B Instruct, accessed securely via the Replicate API. The AI is responsible for generating both fun facts and random topics based on user input.

      **How It Works**

      1. Random Dice Generator — When users are unsure what to search, FiFuFa can generate 6 random topic ideas instantly, offering inspiration from culture, history, and pop trends.

      2. Dynamic Prompting — Each request dynamically builds a tailored prompt in either English or Bahasa Indonesia using optimized temperature, token limits, and penalties for balanced creativity and accuracy.

      3. Smart Validation — Input topics are sanitized and validated (2–50 characters). Invalid or missing topics trigger friendly fallback messages.

      4. RegEx Post-Processing — The output from IBM Granite is cleaned using regular expressions to remove numbering, markdown noise, and ensure clear, polished results.

      5. Bilingual Output — The final facts are presented in English or Bahasa Indonesia, automatically matching the user's selected mode.

      **Why IBM Granite?**

      IBM Granite is designed for enterprise-grade applications, ensuring high security, privacy, and efficient token usage. These characteristics make it ideal for an educational and interactive AI app like FiFuFa.

      **Technical Learnings**

      - Prompt engineering is crucial for consistent, quality AI outputs — small tweaks in wording can significantly affect results
      - RegEx post-processing is essential when working with LLM outputs to ensure clean, user-ready content
      - Fallback systems are non-negotiable for production AI apps — users should never see raw errors

      **Future Improvements**
      - Add more languages (Spanish, Mandarin, etc.)
      - Implement topic categories for guided exploration
