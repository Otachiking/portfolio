      AI-Desa is a comprehensive solution designed to address inefficiencies in manual population data extraction from Indonesian family card (Kartu Keluarga/KK) documents. Village administrators often spend hours manually transcribing data from physical KK documents, leading to human errors, inconsistencies, and delayed data updates.

      As the system architect and UI/UX designer, I developed an end-to-end pipeline that combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Large Language Model (LLM) based text structuring, workflow automation via n8n, and anomaly detection—enabling faster, more reliable, and error-resistant data processing for village-level administration.

      **Problem Discovery & User Research**
      Conducted field interviews with 8 village administrators (perangkat desa) across 3 different villages in Central Java. Key pain points identified:
      - Average 15-20 minutes per KK document for manual data entry
      - 23% error rate in transcribed data (typos, wrong NIK digits, misread dates)
      - No validation system to catch inconsistencies before data submission
      - Physical documents often damaged, faded, or poorly scanned

      **System Architecture Design**
      Designed a modular pipeline architecture consisting of:
      1. **Image Preprocessing Module** — Handles skew correction, contrast enhancement, and noise reduction for scanned/photographed KK documents
      2. **OCR Engine** — Tesseract OCR with Indonesian language pack, fine-tuned for KK document structure
      3. **LLM Text Structurer** — GPT-4 based parser that extracts structured JSON from raw OCR text, handling variations in document formats
      4. **Validation Layer** — Rule-based + ML anomaly detection for NIK checksums, date logic, and family relationship consistency
      5. **n8n Workflow Automation** — Orchestrates the pipeline, handles retries, and routes flagged documents for human review

      **UI/UX Design Process**
      Created user flows and wireframes in Figma, focusing on:
      - Simple drag-and-drop document upload interface
      - Real-time OCR progress visualization
      - Side-by-side view of original document and extracted data for verification
      - Inline editing with auto-save for corrections
      - Dashboard for batch processing and error queue management

      **Prototyping & Iteration**
      Built interactive prototypes and conducted 3 rounds of usability testing with actual village staff. Major iterations included:
      - Adding zoom/pan controls for document preview (users needed to verify small text)
      - Implementing keyboard shortcuts for faster data verification
      - Color-coding confidence scores to prioritize review attention
