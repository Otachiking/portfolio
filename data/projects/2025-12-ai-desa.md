      AI-Desa is a comprehensive solution designed to address inefficiencies in manual population data extraction from Indonesian family card (Kartu Keluarga/KK) documents. Village administrators often spend hours manually transcribing data from physical KK documents, leading to human errors, inconsistencies, and delayed data updates.

      As the system architect and UI/UX designer, I developed an end-to-end pipeline that combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Large Language Model (LLM) based text structuring, workflow automation via n8n, and anomaly detection—enabling faster, more reliable, and error-resistant data processing for village-level administration.

      **Problem Discovery & User Research**
      Conducted field interviews with 8 village administrators (perangkat desa) across 3 different villages in Central Java. Key pain points identified:
      - Average 15-20 minutes per KK document for manual data entry
      - 23% error rate in transcribed data (typos, wrong NIK digits, misread dates)
      - No validation system to catch inconsistencies before data submission
      - Physical documents often damaged, faded, or poorly scanned

      **System Architecture Design**
      Designed a modular pipeline architecture consisting of:
      1. **Image Preprocessing Module** — Handles skew correction, contrast enhancement, and noise reduction for scanned/photographed KK documents
      2. **OCR Engine** — Tesseract OCR with Indonesian language pack, fine-tuned for KK document structure
      3. **LLM Text Structurer** — GPT-4 based parser that extracts structured JSON from raw OCR text, handling variations in document formats
      4. **Validation Layer** — Rule-based + ML anomaly detection for NIK checksums, date logic, and family relationship consistency
      5. **n8n Workflow Automation** — Orchestrates the pipeline, handles retries, and routes flagged documents for human review

      **UI/UX Design Process**
      Created user flows and wireframes in Figma, focusing on:
      - Simple drag-and-drop document upload interface
      - Real-time OCR progress visualization
      - Side-by-side view of original document and extracted data for verification
      - Inline editing with auto-save for corrections
      - Dashboard for batch processing and error queue management

      **Prototyping & Iteration**
      Built interactive prototypes and conducted 3 rounds of usability testing with actual village staff. Major iterations included:
      - Adding zoom/pan controls for document preview (users needed to verify small text)
      - Implementing keyboard shortcuts for faster data verification
      - Color-coding confidence scores to prioritize review attention

      The AI-Desa system was piloted in 2 villages over a 6-week period, processing over 1,200 KK documents. Results showed dramatic improvements in efficiency and accuracy:

      Processing time per document dropped from 15-20 minutes to under 2 minutes (including human verification). The LLM-based structuring achieved 96.4% accuracy on first pass, with the anomaly detection layer catching 99.1% of remaining errors before database submission.

      Village administrators reported significant reduction in repetitive strain and mental fatigue from manual data entry. The system also created an audit trail for all changes, improving data governance compliance.

      **Technical Learnings:**
      - Indonesian KK documents have 4+ layout variations across different years/regions—the LLM approach proved more robust than template matching
      - Preprocessing quality directly impacts OCR accuracy; invested significant effort in image enhancement pipeline
      - n8n proved excellent for rapid prototyping but required custom nodes for complex validation logic

      **Design Insights:**
      - Users trusted the system more when they could see the original document alongside extracted data
      - Confidence scores should be actionable—color coding with thresholds worked better than raw percentages
      - Batch processing UX is fundamentally different from single-document flows; designed separate optimized interfaces

      **Future Improvements:**
      - Expand to other document types (KTP, Akta Kelahiran, etc.)
      - Implement offline-first mobile app for areas with poor connectivity
      - Add Indonesian language voice input for accessibility
