      This project addresses the critical need for automated safety compliance monitoring in industrial environments. Traditional helmet detection systems struggle with nighttime or low-light conditions, creating blind spots in safety monitoring. Our solution leverages advanced computer vision techniques optimized for challenging lighting conditions, enabling 24/7 safety compliance verification without manual intervention.

      The development journey began with extensive research into existing helmet detection solutions and their limitations in low-light environments. We conducted stakeholder interviews with safety officers and plant managers to understand real-world constraints and requirements.

      Our approach followed a structured design thinking methodology:
      
      **Empathize**: Spent time on factory floors during night shifts to understand the actual lighting conditions and camera placements.
      
      **Define**: Identified that existing models trained on daytime data performed poorly (< 40% accuracy) when applied to infrared or low-lux footage.
      
      **Ideate**: Explored multiple approaches including image enhancement preprocessing, transfer learning from night-vision datasets, and custom augmentation strategies.
      
      **Prototype**: Built iterative versions of the detection pipeline, testing with synthetic night-time data before real CCTV footage.
      
      **Test**: Deployed beta versions in controlled environments, gathering performance metrics and user feedback.

      The final model achieved significant improvements over baseline approaches. The system was successfully deployed in two manufacturing facilities, processing over 50,000 frames daily across 12 camera feeds.

      Key impacts include a 60% reduction in manual safety compliance checks and early detection of 47 non-compliance incidents in the first month of deployment. The automated alerting system now sends real-time notifications to safety supervisors, enabling immediate corrective action.

      **Key Learnings:**
      - Domain-specific data augmentation proved more valuable than larger general datasets
      - Edge deployment requires careful optimization of model size vs. accuracy tradeoffs
      - Integration with existing plant systems required significant stakeholder management

      **Accessibility Considerations:**
      - Dashboard designed with high contrast for visibility in control room lighting
      - Alert sounds designed to be distinguishable from existing factory alarms
      - Mobile notifications include both visual and haptic feedback

      **Next Steps:**
      - Extend detection to additional PPE (vests, gloves, goggles)
      - Implement anomaly detection for unusual worker behavior
      - Explore federated learning for multi-site deployment without data sharing
