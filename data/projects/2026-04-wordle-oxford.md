      Wordle Oxford is not just another Wordle clone; it is a specialized educational platform designed for English learners. While the original Wordle provides random entertainment, Wordle Oxford focuses on high-frequency vocabulary sourced directly from the **Oxford 3000 and 5000** lists—the word lists that matter most for CEFR levels A1 through C1.

      The application bridges the gap between gaming and structured learning. By integrating direct dictionary access, powerful solving tools, and competitive modes, Wordle Oxford transforms the daily word-guessing ritual into a comprehensive language-building exercise. Whether you are a beginner aiming for A1 or an advanced learner targeting C1, this tool provides the targeted practice necessary to expand your lexical range.

      **The Problem: Intentional vs. Random Learning**
      Standard word games often use obscure or archaic words that don't help practical language acquisition. Learners need a way to practice the words they actually encounter in exams and professional environments. Wordle Oxford solves this by anchoring every word in the game to the gold standard of English vocabulary—the Oxford Learner's Dictionary.

      **Key Feature Highlights**

      1. **Dictionary Transparency & Authority**
      Every word in the game is derived from the official Oxford 3000-5000 lists. We provide full transparency by linking directly to the [Oxford Learner's Wordlists](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/wordlists/oxford3000-5000), ensuring users learn high-value vocabulary.

      2. **Train Mode: Precision Practice**
      Hone your skills without limits. Train mode allows you to practice as much as you want. You can filter words by their CEFR level (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1) and toggle a timer to simulate pressure or focus on steady learning.

      3. **Comp Mode: The Ultimate Challenge**
      For those who thrive on competition, our Competitive mode features a daily 3-round set that is identical for every player. With a tight time limit per round, it’s a test of speed, accuracy, and vocabulary depth.

      4. **The Advanced Solver**
      Stuck on a tricky word? Our Solver is a game-changer. By inputting your Green (correct), Yellow (misplaced), and Grey (excluded) feedback, the algorithm instantly filters the Oxford dictionary to find possible candidates, turning a moment of frustration into a learning opportunity.

      5. **Integrated Visual Dictionary**
      Learning shouldn't just be about guessing letters. When a word is revealed, you get its full definition, representative emojis for intuitive understanding, its CEFR level, and grammatical details like its part of speech (noun, verb, etc.).

      6. **Context-Aware Hints**
      If you're really stuck, our Hint system offers three layers of assistance:
      - **Definition Hint:** Understand the word's meaning.
      - **Emoji Hint:** Get a visual representation of the concept.
      - **Level Hint:** Find out which CEFR category the word belongs to.

      7. **Game History & Analytics**
      Track your growth over time. The History section provides detailed statistics and a full log of your previous games, allowing you to evaluate your performance and see exactly how many high-level words you've mastered.

      **Technical Implementation**
      Wordle Oxford is built with **React and Vite** for a lightning-fast user experience. The styling is powered by a custom design system that emphasizes clarity and responsiveness. The dictionary data is processed from JSON sources to match the game's constraints while retaining the richness of the Oxford definitions.
